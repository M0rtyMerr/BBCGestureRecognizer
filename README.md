## Installation

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'BBCGestureRecognizer', '~> 8=========D'
```

### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate BBCGestureRecognizer into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "MortyMerr/BBCGestureRecognizer" "8=========D"
```

### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. What is already dead cannot die, so fuck it, use CocoaPods.

### Manually
If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you are not very smart guy and my project is not for you.
